# Cursor AI Development Instructions - SignalHub

## üéØ **MANDATORY GUIDELINES FOR CURSOR AI**

### **ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE PRINCIPLES:**

1. **üìã READ THE GUIDELINES FIRST**
   - Before starting any development, read `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`
   - Follow the 5-minute rule strictly
   - Test after every change

2. **üîç DIAGNOSE BEFORE FIXING**
   - Run `./scripts/quick-debug.sh` to understand the current state
   - Identify the root cause before implementing solutions
   - Don't guess - verify the issue

3. **‚ö° IMPLEMENT INCREMENTALLY**
   - Make one small change at a time
   - Test immediately after each change
   - If it breaks, you know exactly what caused it

4. **üìù DOCUMENT EVERYTHING**
   - Explain what you're doing and why
   - Document any errors and their solutions
   - Update relevant guides when you find new solutions

## üöÄ **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW FOR CURSOR**

### **Step 1: Environment Check (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Always start with this
./scripts/quick-debug.sh
```

### **Step 2: Understand the Request**
- Clarify what the user wants to achieve
- Break it down into small, testable steps
- Identify the simplest possible implementation

### **Step 3: Implement Incrementally**
- Start with the simplest working version
- Add complexity one step at a time
- Test after each addition

### **Step 4: Validate and Document**
- Test the complete feature
- Update documentation
- Provide clear instructions for future use

## üõ†Ô∏è **COMMON PATTERNS FOR CURSOR**

### **When Adding New Features:**
1. **Check current state**: `./scripts/quick-debug.sh`
2. **Create minimal implementation**
3. **Test it works**
4. **Add complexity incrementally**
5. **Document the solution**

### **When Fixing Bugs:**
1. **Reproduce the issue**
2. **Identify root cause**
3. **Implement minimal fix**
4. **Test the fix**
5. **Add prevention measures**

### **When Setting Up New Components:**
1. **Start with basic structure**
2. **Add essential functionality**
3. **Test integration**
4. **Add advanced features**
5. **Optimize and document**

## üéØ **SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMMON TASKS**

### **Frontend Development:**
```bash
# Always start with health check
cd frontend && npm run check

# Use safe development
npm run dev:safe

# Test file resolution
curl -s http://localhost:3000/src/main.tsx | head -3
```

### **Backend Development:**
```bash
# Check imports
cd backend && python -c "import app"

# Test API
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check logs
tail -f logs/signalhub.log
```

### **Database Changes:**
```bash
# Test connection
psql -d signalhub -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check migrations
# (Add specific commands based on your migration system)
```

## üö® **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES FOR CURSOR**

### **When Things Go Wrong:**
1. **Stop immediately** - don't continue building on broken foundation
2. **Run diagnostics**: `./scripts/quick-debug.sh`
3. **Identify the issue** - what exactly broke?
4. **Implement minimal fix** - simplest solution that works
5. **Test thoroughly** - ensure no regressions
6. **Document the issue and solution**

### **When User Reports Issues:**
1. **Ask for specific error messages**
2. **Request current state information**
3. **Run diagnostics to understand the environment**
4. **Reproduce the issue if possible**
5. **Implement targeted fix**
6. **Test the fix thoroughly**
