# Project Journal – Guide

Purpose
- Capture approach, decisions, issues, and lessons as we work.
- Enable a quick, end‑to‑end retrospective to improve future projects.

When To Write
- At plan approvals (Decision Pack summary).
- After each implementation burst (what changed, what worked/failed).
- When major issues or pivots occur.
- At project milestones and final wrap‑up.

How To Use
- Keep entries short and factual (5–10 minutes each).
- Link to commits/PRs, logs, or build artifacts when relevant.
- Prefer one entry per meaningful event over daily filler.

Entry Template
- Date:
- Phase/Milestone:
- Goal: one‑liner.
- Context: why now; relevant background.
- Options considered: bullets with trade‑offs.
- Chosen approach & rationale:
- Implementation summary: files touched, key changes.
- Issues/Risks: what surfaced and mitigations.
- Validation: how we proved it (tests, logs, screenshots/paths).
- Outcome: what shipped/verified.
- Follow‑ups: next tasks, blockers.
- Lessons learned: keep it brief and actionable.
- Links: commits/PRs/docs/paths.

Tips
- Write for future you; assume you forgot the details.
- Capture intent and reasoning, not just “what changed”.
- Prefer specific evidence (URLs, file paths, commands).
